#React Native Practices

*Project uses npx, so whenever you're executing react-native terminal commands within the 'client' folder, make sure you preface your instruction with 'yarn' rather than 'npm' or 'npx' - eg. 'yarn react-native run-ios'

*If you run into CompileC errors on build for ios, cd into 'client/ios', run 'rm -rf Pods' and then 'pod install'

*If you run into 'unable to resolve module' warnings, run 'yarn install' then 'yarn start --reset-cache'
