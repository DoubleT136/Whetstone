#React Native Practices

*Project uses npx, so whenever you're executing react-native terminal commands within the 'client' folder, make sure you preface your instruction with 'npx' rather than 'npm' or 'yarn' - eg. 'npx react-native run-ios'

*If you run into CompileC errors on build for ios, cd into 'client/ios', run 'rm -rf Pods' and then run 'pod install'
